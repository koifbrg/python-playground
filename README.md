# python-playground

Welcome to my Python Playground — a messy, magical garden of experiments in code form, and real steps in my learning journey.

This repository contains mini-projects, snippets, tests, and playful programs that reflect how I’m learning Python one project at a time.  
Everything here was built by me, while figuring out what kind of developer I want to become (spoiler: a weird one).

## What you’ll find here

Each folder contains a small, self-contained project, most of them playful.

### Current contents

- **01_user-hostile-interface/**  
  My first complete Python script — a text-based, passive-aggressive Q&A that mocks the user while teaching me about `input()`, `try/except`, `if/else`, and custom logic.
  
- *(More folders coming soon... stay tuned!)*  
  Planned: a personal music catalog system, a mini metadatabase, file validators, and more.

## Why this exists

I created this repo as a way to:

- Track my growth as I move from beginner to confident Python dev
- Capture ideas in code before they disappear into a notebook
- Show future collaborators (or employers!) what kind of problems I like solving — and how I solve them

## Philosophy

This isn’t about perfection. It’s about momentum.  
Even silly projects have value when they help you understand *why* something works — or fails.  
And yes, I believe programming should feel like play.

## About me

I'm Koi Fábrega — a multidisciplinary artist, singer-songwriter, and non-binary dev in training.  
Currently shifting into tech with a strong focus on music, data, fairness, and expression.

♡ Learning Python, Git, Linux, and databases.  
♡ Writing an album while imagining tools that could support artists like me.  
♡ On a path to use technology to serve the creative world — helping musicians, artists, and weirdos like me build, share, and protect what they make.
