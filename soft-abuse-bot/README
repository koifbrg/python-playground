# First Python Project — Soft Abuse Bot

This is the very first complete Python script I ever built, and yes — it's **absolutely ridiculous**.  
It's a text-based conversation full of sarcasm, questionable language, and passive-aggressive humor.  
The point? To learn how to take user input, validate it, and respond dynamically. The result?  
A mess that actually works (and made me laugh). So, success.

## What does it do?

- Asks the user if they're a "boy" or a "girl" (and mocks them either way)
- Requests a favorite number and:
  - Checks if it's actually a number
  - Responds differently to certain "special numbers" (like 666 or 69)
  - Lies about sharing the same favorite number, because trust issues
- Reacts to the user's belief or disbelief with even more sass

## What I practiced

- `input()` and how to collect user data
- `try/except` blocks to handle errors (like people who write "potato" instead of a number)
- `if/elif/else` logic with custom responses
- Using `f-strings` to personalize messages
- Dictionaries to store special number reactions
- Writing clean-ish structure in a fun, testable way

## ⚠ Disclaimer ⚠

- This code includes some swearing and sarcastic insults.  
- It was written by someone who was extremely proud of making Python finally talk back.  
- It's not meant for professional environments unless your job involves teaching sarcasm to robots.

## Why it matters

Even if it's silly, this script represents a huge step:  
→ The moment I stopped just *learning about Python*, and actually *used it to create something*.

It’s also a reminder that learning can (and should) be weird, funny, and personal.
